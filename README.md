# Save The Cat - Math Quiz

We do basic mental calculations on a daily basis, but how good are we actually?

Hello there, welcome to my page! As a math tutor, I have always wanted to create an engaging game that not only stimulates the mind, but is also enjoyable. "Save The Cat" is a game that tests your mental calculation abilities and reflexes. With adorable graphics and a simple storyline, my main target audience will be for players who are looking for a fun game to build up on their math foundation. If you are looking to challenge yourself and bring your mental calculation skills to the next level, this is definitely a game for you!

### Summary

This is my first project after two weeks in a Software Engineering Immersive course. I am glad that General Assembly has given me this great opportunity to explore the different ways in programming. I have enjoyed myself thoroughly through this process and discovered my interest in creating applications. There is definitely much room for improvement, but I believe I will only get better as I progress. 

Hope you enjoy the game!
