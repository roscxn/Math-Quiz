# Save The Cat - Math Quiz

Hello there, welcome to my page! As a math tutor, I have always wanted to create an engaging game that not only stimulates the mind, but is also enjoyable. "Save The Cat" is a game that tests on your reflexes and a lot more on your mental calculation abilities. With adorable graphics and a simple storyline, my main target audience would be for players who are looking for a fun game to build up on their math foundation. If you are looking to challenge yourself and bring your mental calculation skills to the next level, this is definitely a game for you!

"Save The Cat" comprises of three levels, each with an increasing difficulty than the previous one. Numbers and arithmetic operators will be randomly generated each round. Players will have to type in their answers into the input box and press the "enter" button on their keyboard to submit their answers. A correct answer will enable the superhero to fly higher, while an incorrect answer will cause the hero to fall lower. The objective of the game is to let the superhero fly to the cat and save the cat off the high-rise building. To achieve that, players will have to get 11 correct answers within the time limit.
